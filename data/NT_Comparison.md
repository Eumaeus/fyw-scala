## Luke 1.1-1.4

[1] Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us, [2] even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us, [3] it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus; [4] that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.

## John 1.1-1.4

[1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] The same was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made. [4] In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
